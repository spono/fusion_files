# fusion_files
Updated interface files for LDV-FUSION (USDA-FS) on QGIS  2.x

The original folder 'lidar' in teh installation path should be substituted with the folder provided here.
I personally modified and updated the original files from the QGIS project and added some missing tools to comply with FUSION-LDV 3.60 .

In QGIS 3.x the lidar toolbox (Fusion and Lastools) has been split into two different providers for the Processing. I have no knowledgeabout Python 3 or the new QGIS API so I won't update these files.
