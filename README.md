# fusion_files
This repository contains the updated files of the simple processing interface for [FUSION-LDV (USDA-Forest Service)](http://forsys.sefs.uw.edu/fusion/fusionlatest.html) on **QGIS  2.x** .


The original folder 'lidar' in the installation path should be replaced with the folder provided here.
I personally modified and updated the original files from the QGIS project and added some missing tools to comply with FUSION-LDV 3.70 .

In QGIS 3.x the lidar toolbox (Fusion and Lastools) has been split into two different providers for the Processing.
I have no knowledge about Python 3 or the new QGIS API so I won't update these files.
